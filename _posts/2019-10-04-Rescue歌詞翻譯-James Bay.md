I found you all alone

我發現妳獨自一人

I came to warm your bones

便前來關心

There were twenty million tears in your hands

我了解妳曾經歷過的無數悲傷

You found me in the dark

你發現我在黑暗中

You came to heal my scars

設法治癒我的傷疤

I was slipping, sinking through the sand

從中發現我曾經歷的挫折

They say the more you love, the harder you fall

人們總說愛得越深傷得越重

But I would rather hurt than nothing at all

但我寧可義無反顧也不願不曾經歷過

Through the good, through the bad, through the lonely

經歷過甜蜜悲傷孤獨

I always rescue you, you always rescue me

我們總是拯救彼此



We never draw the line

我們從不在彼此之前劃限

But only 'cause you're mine

這是因為妳是我的人

Only 'cause you promise me I'm yours

因為妳曾承諾妳是我的人

You made me fall apart

你讓我的心崩潰

My sewn together heart

我那好不容易縫合起來的心

Is better when you're walking through the door

在事情過去後才逐漸好轉

You know you keep me alive, oh

妳知道的妳就是我活著的意義

They say the more you love, the harder you fall

人們總說愛得越深傷得越重

But I would rather hurt than nothing at all

但我寧可義無反顧也不願不曾經歷過

Through the good, through the bad, through the lonely

經歷過甜蜜悲傷孤獨

I always rescue you, you always rescue me

我們總是拯救彼此

I rescue you

我拯救妳

You rescue me

妳拯救我

I shelter you, you guide me

我庇護妳 妳引領我

I lose myself, you find me

我失去自己而妳總能發現真正的我

I shelter you, you guide me

我庇護妳 妳引領我

I shelter you

我庇護妳

They say the more you love, the harder you fall

人們總說愛得越深傷得越重

But I would rather hurt than nothing at all

但我寧可義無反顧也不願不曾經歷過

Through the good, through the bad, through the lonely

經歷過甜蜜悲傷孤獨

I always rescue you, you always rescue me

我們總是拯救彼此

I always rescue you

我總是解救妳

I rescue you

解救妳

You always rescue me

妳總是解救我

You rescue me

解救我

I always rescue you

我總是解救妳

I rescue you

我解救妳

Oh, I always rescue you

我總是解救妳

You always rescue me

妳總是解救了我

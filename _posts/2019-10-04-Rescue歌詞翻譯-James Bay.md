I found you all alone

我發現妳獨自一人

I came to warm your bones

便前來安慰妳
There were twenty million tears in your hands

妳已經歷過無數悲傷

You found me in the dark

你發現我在黑暗中

You came to heal my scars

你前來治癒我的傷口

I was slipping, sinking through the sand

我已沒入流沙中

They say the more you love, the harder you fall

人們總說愛得越深傷得越重

But I would rather hurt than nothing at all

但我寧可受傷也不願一無所有

Through the good, through the bad, through the lonely

經歷過甜蜜悲傷孤獨

I always rescue you, you always rescue me

我們總是拯救彼此

We never draw the line

But only 'cause you're mine

Only 'cause you promise me I'm yours

You made me fall apart

My sewn together heart

Is better when you're walking through the door

You know you keep me alive, oh

They say the more you love, the harder you fall

But I would rather hurt than nothing at all

Through the good, through the bad, through the lonely

I always rescue you, you always rescue me

I rescue you

You rescue me

I shelter you, you guide me

I lose myself, you find me

I shelter you, you guide me

I shelter you

They say the more you love, the harder you fall

But I would rather hurt than nothing at all

Through the good, through the bad, through the lonely

I always rescue you, you always rescue me

I always rescue you

I rescue you

You always rescue me

You rescue me

I always rescue you

I rescue you

Oh, I always rescue you

You always rescue me
